# My life in Phantom Forces

So, I play this game on Roblox called Phantom Forces. And Phantom Forces is made by a group of developers called StyLis Studios. Phantom Forces is a fun game to play, especially when you're fiddling with different attachments and weapon skins to put on your gun. I should probably explain that Phantom Forces (pf for short) is a gun game. It has unlockable guns and melee weapons. 

Let's talk about the guns first. You start off with one gun from each class, and each category in each of the classes. And there are 4 classes: Assault, Scout, Support, and Recon. There are 4 sub-classes in each main class, so 4 sub-classes x 4 main classes = A LOT of guns. In the assault class, the 4 categories are: Assault Rifles, and other categories. In Scout class, there are: PDW's, and other weapons. In Support, there are LMG's, and other things I can't remember. And in the Recon class, there are: Sniper Rifles (my favourite), DMR's, and I think Carbine and Shotgun. Same goes with the Scout class to. 

To unlock new weapons, you can rank up gradually, or you can buy weapons with in-game currency, called credits. You can get credits by selling skins, ranking up, or buying them with _Robux_. Robux is the money used in Roblox, to buy gear and clothing for your avatar. Anyway, back to pf. We were talking about knives, or melee weapons. You can unlock different melee weapons by ranking up, buying them, or rolling them from cases. But enough of melees. 

There are also secondaries. There are pistols, revolver's, machine pistols, small shotguns, and mini snipers. Some can be garbage, like the Zip-22(trash pistol), some can be decent, like the 1858 New Army (revolver), or the Tec-9 (machine pistol), and some can be amazing, like the M45A1 (pistol), Deagle 44 (pistol), or the SFG 50 (mini sniper). And every single _GUN_ in the game has attachments. Like, are you going to put a laser on a Nordic War Axe (aka knife, melee, or two-handed blade.) to chop people precisely? _HA_. _Yeah right_. But anyways, I hope you like this essay, and that it is at least 300 words (or a bit more). My hand hurts now. _Byeeee!!!_
